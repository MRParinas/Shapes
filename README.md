# Shapes

As I embarked on my second project in the realm of web development, the challenge was set to dive deeper into the intricacies of HTML and CSS, with a particular focus on creating and manipulating shapes. This project was not just about reinforcing my foundational knowledge but also about exploring the boundaries of style creation and the dynamic visualization capabilities of CSS. Here's a glimpse into that journey.

After successfully navigating the basics of web development in my initial project, I felt excited with the next learning step in the program. Drawing from my new learnings with HTML and CSS, I went into the next learning project in the program that revolved around creating shapes. The goal was simple to most yet quite challenging for a novice like myself: to design a webpage that not only displayed various geometric figures but also encapsulated the essence of style and transformation through CSS.

The core of this project lied in CSS, where the real magic of shape transformation took place. My first task was to draw basic shapes - circles and squares. Utilizing CSS properties such as border-radius and background-color, I began crafting these figures, experimenting with colors to bring vibrancy to the canvas of my webpage. The simplicity of creating a circle by setting the border-radius to 50% or a square with defined height and width was both fascinating and empowering.

The project took an exciting turn when I decided to introduce a 3D element - a cube, to be precise. This was a leap into the deep end, requiring a more sophisticated understanding of CSS properties like transform and perspective. The cube was constructed using six div elements, each representing a face of the cube. Manipulating these elements in a 3D space with rotate and translate properties was challenging. It demanded precision and a keen understanding of how elements are visualized in a three-dimensional context.

This project was more than just an exercise in coding; it was a voyage of discovery into the depths of CSS and a testament to the power of self-learning. Each shape on my webpage stood as a milestone, marking my progression from a beginner to someone capable of bringing ideas to life through code. The project underscored the importance of patience, experimentation, and resilience. Facing errors and overcoming them became a routine part of the process, each challenge a lesson in disguise.

In reflection, the shapes project was not just about learning the creation of geometric figures through code; it was about laying the foundation for more complex projects ahead. It was a stepping stone, one that has prepared me to dive even deeper into the intricacies of web development, armed with the knowledge that with determination, any challenge can be transformed into an opportunity for growth.
